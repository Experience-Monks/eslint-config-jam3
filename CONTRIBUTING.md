# Contributing to this library

Thinking about getting involved with the library? Great!, there are a few things you need to know.

## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Branching

Our `master` branch has the latest code, with tests passing after every PR is merged. However if you want to use the latest stable version is recommended to download the latest release.

## Semantic Versioning

We follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.

We tag every pull request with a label marking whether the change should go in the next patch, minor, or a major version.

Every significant change is documented in the [changelog file](CHANGELOG.md).

## Bugs

We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. Before creating a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesnâ€™t already exist.

We are using a template for our issues, using this template will reduce the time of understanding the issue and creating a solution.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are welcome, please follow our template and our [guidelines](CODE_REVIEW.md)
